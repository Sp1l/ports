MariaDB respects hier(7) and doesn't check /etc, /etc/mysql and
/var/db/mysql for my.cnf. Please merge existing my.cnf files from those
paths with %%ETCDIR%%/conf.d/. Sample configuration files are provided in
%%ETCDIR%% and %%ETCDIR%%/conf.d.
Multi-instance configurations retain the old behavior.

Files/paths:
   %%ETCDIR%%/my.cnf - Configuration for all utilities, includes conf.d/*.cnf
   %%ETCDIR%%/conf.d/client.cnf - Configuration for client utilities
   %%ETCDIR%%/conf.d/server.cnf - Configuration for server
   %%ETCDIR%%/conf.d/wsrep.cnf  - Configuration for wsrep clustering
   %%MARIADB_RUNDIR%%/mysql.sock - mysqld listening socket
   %%MARIADB_LOGDIR%% - mysqld logfiles
   /var/run/mysqld.pid - mysqld PID file

This port does NOT include the mytop perl script, this is included in
the MariaDB tarball but the most recent version can be found in the
databases/mytop port
