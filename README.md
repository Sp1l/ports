FreeBSD ports

Check this out in your poudriere and set that directory as an overlay (`-O`)

LibreSSL fixes for FreeBSD ports usually committed as PR and upstream where possible
* lang/python: all versions in ports. These patches will appear in the coming fix versions of upstream
* www/apache24
* ftp/wget
* security/tor
This is usually NOT original work but ported from OpenBSD's ports or the Gentoo LibreSSL sources

MariaDB / MySQL / PerconaDB
Maintainer for MariaDB 10.0
Patches for MySQL etc may end up here as well

Should be a complete forked repo some time
